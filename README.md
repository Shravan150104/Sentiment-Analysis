# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter sentiment analysis analyzes the sentiment or emotion of tweets. It uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets automatically as positive or negative based on their content. It can be done for individual tweets or a larger dataset related to a particular topic or event.

We aim to analyze Twitter sentiment analysis Dataset using machine learning algorithms, the sentiment of tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 Scores.
